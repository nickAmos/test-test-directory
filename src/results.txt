things to add:

Dedication regional/metropolitan instructions (laboratory Info) (done)

Ordering infomation for collector (collector info) (done)

fix 24 Urine storage instructions (done)


fix image display and change collection instructions. 

if additional collection instructions are > than X display a 
'see collector info' text which when click moves position of
page to the colllector infomation tab.
  - fix when text is long displaying in both boxes 

Styling to fit pascal theme **

add reffered links  back to basic info
