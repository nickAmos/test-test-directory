Dose determination for Clozapine is primarily based upon clinical response/haematological state/metabolic adverse events/cardiac adverse events. Wide inter- and intra-patient variability in plasma Clozapine levels exists and monitoring is useful for assessing compliance or assessing toxic levels. Whilst some studies have recommended a \u2018therapeutic range\u2019 evidence from multiple prospective, randomised, controlled clinical studies on a role for Clozapine TDM in determining dose is lacking. Similarly rigorous evidence of a specific toxic level is not available. Therefore, the reference range quoted with results (100 to 800 \u00b5g/L) is deliberately wider than most proposed \u2018therapeutic ranges\u2019 (of between approx 350 to 600 \u00b5g/L) and it is based on a range of evidence from different literature reports and on data from our laboratory. Levels > 800 \u00b5g/L are flagged as high, < 100 \u00b5g/L are flagged as low and levels > 1500 \u00b5g/L warrant urgent (telephone) reporting.

This test is available at all Austin Pathology Collection Centres. The test should not be performed if the patient is under stress, eg post recent AMI, surgery, or when they are ill. Please note: At present, we are following RANZCOG RECOMMENDATIONS for the SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF GESTATIONAL DIABETES. The relevant recommendations are listed below: If a woman is currently positive for COVID-19, symptomatic or in isolation awaiting test results, GDM testing should be delayed until after that period. For patients with identifiable risk factors for GDM, an HbA1c should be performed with antenatal serology. A cutoff of 5.9% should be considered diagnostic of GDM. Women with previous GDM should either have a fasting blood glucose level tested at 24-28 weeks gestation or be considered as having GDM and commence home BGM from 28 weeks gestation All other women should have a fasting blood glucose at 24-28 weeks with GDM diagnosed if glucose is >=5.1mmol/L Postnatal GTT should be deferred until the resolution of the pandemic, unless post-natal blood glucose levels are elevated This advice is not exhaustive and does not attempt to cover every scenario. Furthermore, individual clinical circumstances vary and all clinicians should apply appropriate discretion.",

It is important to understand that cut-off values may vary even between laboratories using the same testing method, depending on the patient population tested and the sensitivity/specificity desired. In general, lower cut-offs (e.g. around 30) will offer high sensitivity at the expense of specificity while higher cut-offs (e.g. 100) are more specific for primary hyperaldosteronism but may miss milder cases.

A transient elevation in tryptase can occur after a severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, with levels returning to normal on serial testing. Persistently elevated tryptase levels may indicate a rare condition known as mastocytosis. During acute anaphylaxis, serum tryptase levels are increased from 15 min to 3 hours, or even longer after the onset. Although elevated levels support a diagnosis of anaphylaxis, normal levels do not exclude anaphylaxis. It is recommended to repeat tryptase testing at least 24 hours after symptom resolution to ensure the tryptase concentration returns to within the normal range. In rare instances, an elevated baseline tryptase concentration may uncover systemic mastocytosis. After a suspected anaphylactic reaction, serial blood samples are recommended for the interpretation of results and include: An acute sample, collected between 30 minutes and 2 hours after symptom onset (and after the provision of emergency treatment) is optimal NB: a significant increase in tryptase in samples collected up to 4 to 6 hours after an event can still be informative, if earlier samples are unavailable NB: in some cases of anaphylaxis caused by an injected drug, a sample taken immediately after resuscitation and another sample taken within 2 hours may be useful A baseline sample, collected 24 hours after all signs and symptoms have resolved References: Cardona, V., et al.

FOR OPTIMAL RESULTS: Perform LP at least 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. The last tube should be dedicated for xanthochromia analysis. If other tests are required, this may mean collecting a 4th tube. Protect the tube from light immediately e.g. by wrapping tube in foil (as bilirubin in photosensitive). Transport the tube immediately to the laboratory. A serum sample for serum Bilirubin and Total Protein measurement should be collected at the same time as this may be required in difficult interpretations. This sample may be deemed as precious and it is at the discretion of the collections staff whether or not it can be sent via the pneumatic tube system (PTS).

Test of Cure surveillance is a co-test (HPV PCR and Liquid Based Cytology) performed twelve months after treatment and annually thereafter, until the patient receives a negative co-test in two consecutive occasions.

In 2007, the fusion of ALK with EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which results as a chromosome 2p inversion. The frequency of ALK rearrangements ranges from 3-7% in NSCLC patients. There is a higher frequency of ALK rearrangements in younger never to light smokers. ALK1 rearrangements are generally mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ROS1. There are multiple known ALK-EML4 variants which occur in the same region of the ALK gene (exon 20) but involve different breakpoints within the EML4 gene. There are other rare fusion partners including a kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B), TRK-fused gene (TFG) and kinesin light chain 1 (KCL1) also described. Patients which exhibit these rearrangements in NSCLC may show responses to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors e.g. crizotinib. This result needs to be interpreted in the context of the clinical, radiological, morphological, and immunophenotypic features.

Granular IgA staining in dermal papillae. Less common dermatological conditions eg. Linear IgA disease \u2013 consultation with Dermatology unit recommended Vasculitis \u2013 if patient has leucocytoclastic vasculitis, direct immunofluorescence should be performed to diagnose or exclude IgA vasculitis. It is not recommended direct immunofluorescence be performed before vasculitis is confirmed by routing H&E sections, although this will vary with the prebiopsy diagnostic confidence. Other situations \u2013 inspite of some textbooks/literature/standard dogma, direct immunofluorescence is not a useful test in cutaneous lupus. This is a morphological diagnosis, immunofluorescence is often negative or non specific. Discussion with a histopathologist prior to biopsy can often stop unnecessary biopsies and ensure correct procedure. In general, skin biopsies for direct immunofluorescence should be of perilesional tissue (particularly in vesiculobullous lesions). For vasculitic rash, the rash should be sampled. Ulcerated skin should not be biopsied. Direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsies should be performed only in specific clinical settings where one of the immune mediated skin conditions above is suspected.",
